		  <li><strong>Personal background</strong>: I am Joshua Chance, but I go by Josh. I am 22 years old, I'll be 23 in July, and I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. I enjoy playing video games, going out to hang with friends, and traveling.</li>
		  <li><strong>Professional Background</strong>: Right now, I currently work at Amazon and I also work for a temp agency at a warehouse where I can make my own schedule. I used to work at Sonic Drive-In and Valvoline Instant Oil Change.</li>
		  <li><strong>Academic Background</strong>: I graduated Independence High School in 2019 and is currently pursuing a career in Information Technology.</li>
		  <li><strong>Background in this subject</strong>: I honestly had an interest in computers. I even took a couple of computer classes in middle school as part of electives and sometimes for fun I would play computer games. My mom’s friend and cousin of ours are both in the IT business and I plan on getting into the business right when I finish CPCC.</li>
		  <li><strong>Primary computer platform</strong>: I have a samsung chromebook and a windows 10 family computer.</li>
		  <li><strong>Courses I'm in & Why</strong>:
		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="contract.html">WEB250-N801</a> - Database Driven Websites</strong> - Part of a prerequisite for one of my classes left on my progress but I look forward to learning more about this class.</li>
			<li><strong>CSC151-N803 - Java Programming</strong> - One of the major requirements for Information Technology and I’m also retaking it because I didn’t do too well last summer and fall but it is a very interesting course that I am trying to learn more about.</li>
			<li><strong>CSC174-N801 - Server Side Javascript</strong> - One of the major requirements for IT that I plan on to learn more about.</li>
		</ul>
		  <li><strong>Funny/interesting item about yourself</strong>: I used to play the trumpet in my band class in middle school.</li>
